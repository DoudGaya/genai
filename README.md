# GenAI

## Overview

GenAI is an open-source project designed to make artificial intelligence more accessible by allowing users to interact with AI in their native languages. Built on OpenAI's SDK and powered by Next.js, this AI system supports natural language input and generates responses in the same language. It goes beyond text, offering capabilities for image generation, audio synthesis, and video creation.

The primary motivation for this project is to bridge the gap for individuals who face challenges in providing prompts to AI systems due to a lack of proficiency in English. By enabling native language support, we aim to empower everyone, regardless of their linguistic background, to interact seamlessly with AI.

## Features

- **Native Language Input and Output**: Supports languages such as Hausa, Chinese, and other non-English languages for both input and responses.
- **Multi-Modal Generation**: Offers:
  - Text generation
  - Image generation
  - Audio synthesis
  - Video creation
- **Powered by OpenAI**: Leverages OpenAI's cutting-edge SDK for AI capabilities.
- **Built with Next.js**: Ensures a robust and performant web-based interface.

## Motivation

Millions of people worldwide lack proficiency in English, which can hinder their ability to leverage AI technology. Native Language AI is here to solve this problem by:

- Allowing users to provide prompts in their native languages.
- Providing a seamless AI interaction experience tailored to individual linguistic needs.
