# Native Language AI Project

Welcome to the Native Language AI Project! This open-source project aims to break language barriers by allowing users to interact with AI using their native languages. Built with OpenAI's SDK and Next.js, this AI supports multiple languages such as Hausa, Chinese, and many others, providing responses in the same language.

## Motivation

Many people who do not have a background in English face difficulties when interacting with AI systems. Our goal is to solve this problem by enabling users to give prompts to AI in their native languages. This project is not limited to text generation; it also includes image, audio, and video generation capabilities.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate text responses in various native languages.
- **Image Generation**: Create images based on native language prompts.
- **Audio Generation**: Produce audio outputs from native language inputs.
- **Video Generation**: Generate videos using native language descriptions.
